1) I wrote a python script to take in some college data added predictions, 
and also moved it to the last column.

2) SageMaker is used as an AWS Machine Learning tool to make a prediction of whether a user would
be accepted into said college based on their profile data.
In the lambda function, I made it so that a score >0.5 means admitted.
