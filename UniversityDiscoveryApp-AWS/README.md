Some of my contributions:
* Created a login form that stores and verifies information with DynamoDB
* Reformatted University Data and used acceptance data to train ML model in Sagemaker to predict whether an applicant would be admitted to a university
* Implemented Quicksight to display live clicking data (i.e. when a user clicks on a University, the click action is logged, which can be used to display what colleges that users with similar portfolios have viewed)
* AWS: S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Sagemaker, QuickSight
* Programming: Javascript, Python, Jupyter Notebook
